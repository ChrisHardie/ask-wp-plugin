## Using the Ask Wordpress Plugin

Ask integrates seamless with Wordpress. Once you have Ask installed on your own infrastructure (see: https://github.com/coralproject/ask-install), follow these steps:

1. Download the ask-wp-plugin as a zip file
2. Install and activate the plugin on your Wordpress site
3. Configure the plugin via the Settings below and connect your Ask Admin 
4. Create an Ask form and copy the form id from the URL (ex. https://ask.yourdomain.com/forms/your-form-id/)
4. Use the shortcode `[ask-form id="your-form-id"] in any page or post


## Configuring the Ask Wordpress Plugin

To use Ask forms in Wordpress, you will need to set a Form Base URL, which is where your forms are stored:

Form Base URL ________________________
Ex. https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-s3-bucket/ 

You can also optionally manage your forms in Wordpress, by providing the URL where your Ask admin is located:

Admin Base URL ________________________
Ex. https://ask.mydomain.com
